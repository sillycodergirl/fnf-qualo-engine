# Qualo Engine (Psych Engine 0.7.3 fork)

***THIS IS NOT FINISHED!!!! YOU MAY USE IT BUT STUFF MAY BE BROKEN***

Adds a developer testing menu (F8 on the title screen, *MUST HAVE DEVELOPER MODE ON IN PROJECT.XML*)

Cleaner folder layout.

Assets from source can be ported over via the dev options menu. (no code tho, recompile for that)

NO MORE MODS FOLDER SORRY LOSERS
(you can still code lua just throw yall shit into the source assets folder.)


**allowing you to request more features or something idk**
